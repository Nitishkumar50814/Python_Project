#  Fake News Headline Generator (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly **Python project** that generates random **fake news headlines** in two modes:
-  Funny Mode
-  Serious Mode

The project uses simple Python concepts like lists, loops, conditionals, user input, and the `random` module.

---

##  Features

- Two headline modes: **Funny** and **Serious**
- Random selection of subjects, actions, and places
- Continuous headline generation using a loop
- Easy-to-read and beginner-friendly code
- User-controlled execution (yes/no)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Built-in `random` module

---

## ▶️ How It Works
1. User selects a mode: `funny` or `serious`
2. Program randomly selects:
   - A subject
   - An action
   - A place
3. A complete headline is generated in this format:

## 🧪 Sample Examples

### 🎭 Funny Mode

### Choose mode (funny/serious): funny
```

Breaking News: The sun is dancing near India Gate
Do you want another headline? (yes/no): yes

Breaking News: My house is cooking on the buffalo
Do you want another headline? (yes/no): no
```

### Choose mode (funny/serious): serious
```
Breaking News: The government announced a new policy in the parliament
Do you want another headline? (yes/no): yes

Breaking News: Students are preparing for exams across the country
Do you want another headline? (yes/no): no
```

## 🧠 Key Python Concepts Used
- `random.choice()` for random selection
- Lists to store headline components
- `while` loop for continuous execution
- `if-elif-else` for mode selection
- String formatting using f-strings
- User input handling

---

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of Python control flow
- Learned to work with lists and randomness
- Practiced building an interactive CLI application
- Gained confidence in writing beginner-level Python projects
